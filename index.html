      <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-center display-4">Welcome to <span class="text-primary">Key Club</span> at WHCI!</h2>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Who Are We?</h4>
      <p>
        We are Key Club, one of the oldest student-run service organizations in North America.
        Our goal is to empower student leaders everywhere to help themselves, their friends and peers, and their community.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">What Can We do to Help <span class="text-info">You?</span></h4>
      <p>
        As students, you are required to reach at least 40 volunteer hours to gain an <abbr title="Ontario Secondary School Diploma">OSSD</abbr>.
        We want to make that task as simple as possible for you to achieve.
        As a Key Clubber, you won't have to search for volunteer opportunities, because <span class="text-success">we'll do the searching for you!</span>
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">What Are The Requirements?</h4>
      <p>
        Key Clubbers are expected to do <span class="text-danger">at least 10 volunteer hours per semester</span>, although this number is subject to change.
        Anyone from Grades 9-12 may join the club; please encourage your friends to come!
        No dues or other fees are required to join the club, although going to events may cost money depending on the distance.
        You do not need to go to any events however, as we will be hosting a bi-weekly school cleanup!
      </p>

      <h4 id="current_officers" class="font-weight-bold">Who's In Charge?</h4>
      <p>
        We are a student-run organization, which means that we each report to ourselves and our fellow club members.
        We do however, have seven executive club leaders. These leaders are elected each year by the club's members.

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">What's Being an Officer Like?</h4>
      <p>
        Officers are not that far from regular members. They have the same hour requirements as regular members,
        and they are not necessarily required to go to any of the events either (although it is highly recommended).
        Officers are however, required to suggest at least two volunteer opportunities for the club to participate in over the course of the semester.
